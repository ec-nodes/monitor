# NodesMonitor
Ethernity Cloud Node Monitoring:

This webpage displays information about the time since the last contract call of nodes in the Ethernity Cloud ecosystem, including the node name and address. Users can also add or remove a node. If the time since the last transaction is greater than 15 hours, the node name will be displayed in red for easier identification of a possible error.

To access this page, create a shortcut on your desktop or home screen for https://ec-nodes.github.io/monitor/ using any web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari). For Android users, an apk app can be downloaded here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8s8vb6n918qdykg/EC%20Node%20Monitor.apk?dl=1

Note: The webpage uses local storage to save node information in cookies, so the data will be kept until you delete or uninstall the browser, even if it is closed or refreshed. Installing the Android app helps to save the node list when uninstalling or clearing the browser memory (the app uses "Android WebView").
